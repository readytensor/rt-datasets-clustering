# Datasets for Clustering Base category on Ready Tensor

This repo contains all files related to the datasets used in algorithm evaluation for the Clustering - Base category.

The `datasets` folder contains the main data files and the schema files for all the benchmark datasets under Clustering - Base category. Within each dataset folder in `datasets`:

- The `raw` folder contains the original data files from the source (see attributions below).
- `processed` folder contains the compressed, processed files. These files are used in algorithm evaluations.
  - The CSV file with suffix "\_train.csv" is used for training
  - "\_test.csv" is used for testing (without the targets)
  - "\_test_key.csv" contains the targets for the test data. This test key file is used to generate scores by comparing with predictions.
  - The JSON file with suffix "\_schema.json" is the schema file for the corresponding dataset.
  - The json file with the suffix "\_infer_req.json" contains a sample JSON object with the data to make an inference request to the /infer endpoint.
  - The CSV file with the dataset name, and no other suffix, is the full data (made of both train and test sets).
- The Jupyter notebook file within each dataset folder is used to convert the raw data file(s) in `raw` folder into the processed form in `processed` folder.
- The folder `schema_cfg` contains a csv which is needed by the schema generation script (described below) .

`schema_gen` folder contains a schema gen config file (YAML) and a python script which are used to generate the JSON schema files stored in the `processed` folder for each dataset. The generated schema file conforms to the Ready Tensor specification for this category.

## Credit Card

#### Alias (in scorecards): credit_card

#### Domain / Industry: Financial services

#### Description

This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks.
The original dataset comes with a cost matrix. However, it is ignored in this evaluation since the Binary-Classification-Base category does not incorporate cost matrix.
In the original dataset, the target classes were marked as “+” and “-”. These have been replaced by “positive” and “negative”.

#### Dataset characteristics

- Number of samples = 690
- Number of input features = 16
- Has categorical features = Yes
- Has missing values = Yes

## Spambase

#### Alias (in scorecards): spambase

#### Domain / Industry: Technology / Internet Services

#### Description

This dataset contains collection of spam and non-spam emails converted to numerical features. Spam e-mails came from postmaster and individuals who had filed spam.Non-spam e-mails came from filed work and personal e-mails, and hence the word 'george' and the area code '650' are indicators of non-spam. These are useful when constructing a personalized spam filter. One would either have to blind such non-spam indicators or get a very wide collection of non-spam to generate a general purpose spam filter.

#### Dataset characteristics

- Number of samples = 4,601
- Number of input features = 57
- Has categorical features = No
- Has missing values = No
